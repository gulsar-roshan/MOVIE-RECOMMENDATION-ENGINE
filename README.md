# Movie Recommendation Engine

## Project Description
The Movie Recommendation Engine was developed to provide personalized movie recommendations by analyzing user ratings, viewing history, and genre preferences. The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the application of data mining and machine learning techniques to identify patterns between users and movies. By using association rule mining and classification algorithms, the system predicted movies that users were most likely to enjoy, improving content discovery based on user behavior and historical data.

## Project Objectives
- Loaded and preprocessed the movie dataset
- Analyzed movie titles, genres, and user ratings
- Identified unique genres and removed duplicate entries
- Studied user viewing patterns and rating behavior
- Performed exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Grouped movies based on popularity and average ratings
- Implemented a recommendation system using the Apriori algorithm
- Applied machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and KNN
- Generated personalized movie recommendations
- Evaluated recommendation performance using association metrics

## Skills Applied
- Python Programming
- Data Analysis using Pandas and NumPy
- Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning Fundamentals
- Data Mining Techniques
- Recommendation System Development
- Association Rule Mining (Apriori Algorithm)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Statistical Analysis and Interpretation

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- MLxtend (Apriori Algorithm)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Output
The system generated movie recommendations based on user preferences, genre similarity, and rating patterns. Association rule metrics such as Support, Confidence, Lift, and Conviction were used to evaluate recommendation strength and accuracy.
